# This Lab will use Ansible to download, deploy and configure PPDM Agents and Registrations

## The Inventory File

ansible communicates with remote hosts using ssh / winrm. Remote hsost do not require ansible to be deployed, but Python.
Python is already configured on the Remote Hosts. 

Remote Hosts are treated as "Inventory", that ansible will Gather "Facts" from ( OS releated information, Network Softaware etc )

We can define our Inventory via Invetory Files. Most Likely. Inventory files are stored in a GitOps Structure

### Example Inventory File

```yaml
windows:    # <- a group of Hosts addressed as windows
  children:
    databasehosts:  # <- a group of Hosts addressed as databasehosts
      hosts:
        sql01: # <- an indivisual Host adressed as sql01
        sql02:
          ansible_host: sql02.demo.local # <- an indivisual Host adressed as sql02. resolvable as sql02.demo.local
      vars: # specific Vars for the Group Database Hosts
        app_agent: "{{ msapp_agent_windows }}"
        app_agent_product_id: '{165F48F4-38C4-49DF-904E-4A23D39078BF}'
    filehosts:
      hosts:
        file:
      vars:
        app_agent: "{{ fs_agent_windows }}"
        app_agent_product_id: '{49C974B3-BA72-485C-9A96-794B065339DF}'
    exchangehosts:
      hosts:
        exchange1:
        exchange2:
      vars:
        app_agent: "{{ exchange_agent_windows }}"
        app_agent_product_id: '{165F48F4-38C4-49DF-904E-4A23D39078BF}'
  vars: # -> vars for all Windows Hosts
    ansible_user: administrator
    ansible_password: Password123!
    ansible_winrm_scheme: https
    ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
    ansible_shell_type: cmd
    ansible_connection: winrm
```
