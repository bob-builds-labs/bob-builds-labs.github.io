# This Lab will use Ansible to download, deploy and configure PPDM Agents and Registrations

## Variable Assignments
the lab uses automated, prepopulated Variables for most of the ansible Playbooks  
The Variable are assigne via Environment vars, loaded automatically by the "direnv" utility  
This perfecrly Simulates a Pipeline approach, we Variables would be assigned from a Reqiest Tool suchj as Snow, and Credentials via a Vault
Please make sure to use the assigned directories for the labs

## The Inventory File

ansible communicates with remote hosts using ssh / winrm. Remote hsost do not require ansible to be deployed, but Python.
Python is already configured on the Remote Hosts. 

Remote Hosts are treated as "Inventory", that ansible will Gather "Facts" from ( OS releated information, Network Softaware etc )

We can define our Inventory via Invetory Files. Most Likely, Inventory files are stored in a GitOps Structure. The Inventory Files are stored with the adjesent lab directories

### Example Inventory File

```yaml
windows:    # <- a group of Hosts addressed as windows
  children:
    databasehosts:  # <- a group of Hosts addressed as databasehosts
      hosts:
        sql01: # <- an indivisual Host adressed as sql01
        sql02:
          ansible_host: sql02.demo.local # <- an indivisual Host adressed as sql02. resolvable as sql02.demo.local
      vars: # specific Vars for the Group Database Hosts
        app_agent: "{{ msapp_agent_windows }}"
        app_agent_product_id: '{165F48F4-38C4-49DF-904E-4A23D39078BF}'
    filehosts:
      hosts:
        file:
      vars:
        app_agent: "{{ fs_agent_windows }}"
        app_agent_product_id: '{49C974B3-BA72-485C-9A96-794B065339DF}'
    exchangehosts:
      hosts:
        exchange1:
        exchange2:
      vars:
        app_agent: "{{ exchange_agent_windows }}"
        app_agent_product_id: '{165F48F4-38C4-49DF-904E-4A23D39078BF}'
  vars: # -> vars for all Windows Hosts
    ansible_user: administrator
    ansible_password: Password123!
    ansible_winrm_scheme: https
    ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
    ansible_shell_type: cmd
    ansible_connection: winrm
```
## Change to lab1 direcory
changing to lab1 directory will load the required variables for lab1

```bash
cd ~/workspace/0499/lab3
direnv allow .
```

## list  Agents on PPDM Host 
```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.0_list_agents.yml
```

## Download Agents from PPDM Host to JumpBox
```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.1_download_agents.yml
```
![image](https://github.com/bob-builds-labs/bob-builds-labs.github.io/assets/8255007/9f62f030-ef02-415a-95bb-8b93309b6767)


this will create a directory structure in /tmp by default ( destination can be changed with variable )

## configure PPDM to use DNS for Agent name Resolution
as we will register the agents to ppdm using the fqdn, we need to enable DNS for Agents on the PPDM Host:

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.2_set_dns_for_agents.yaml
```
