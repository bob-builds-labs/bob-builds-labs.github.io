# Onboard Openshift into PPDM


## Preparation
If not already done, clone into the  [ansible ppdm repo](https://github.com/bottkars/ansible_ppdm)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bottkars/ansible_ppdm ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm
```

Also, clone into the [ansible ppdd repo](https://github.com/bottkars/ansible_ppdm)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bottkars/ansible_ppdd ~/workspace/ansible_ppdd
```
## Onboarding PPDM
For onboarding PPDM, we leverage Ansible k8s modules to gather information about the Cluster as well as deploying our RBAC files, secrets and PPDM Namespace.  
the .envrc Pre-Loads the path to our KUBECONFIG file and some Environment Variables for PPDM


### Deploy RBAC templates and onboard the cluster
Playbook *130.1_playbook_rbac_add_k8s_to_ppdm.yaml* will do the magic of applying the RBAC, roles, assignments, secrets and other required resources. When *vcenter_address* is Specified, the Playbook will instruct PPDM to onboard a "VANILLA_ON_VSPHERE" Cluster, means, secrets for vcenter FCD will be provided in powerprotect namespace ( equals a *csi drivers as a process* switch in PPDM )
The Playbook is designed to run Initially an on Updates, as it will *ensure* the correct settings 

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/130.1_playbook_rbac_add_k8s_to_ppdm.yaml -e vcenter_address=vcenter01.demo.local
```

this will depoloy the PowerProtect controller Pods, as well as the OADP Operator in namespace velero-ppdm

### create k8s policy and Rule

The next Playbook will create a Protection Policy with an attached Protection Rule. The rule will watch for namespaces with the Label *ppdm_policy=PPDM_GOLD*

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/130.2_playbook_add_k8s_policy_and_rule.yaml
```
