## Onboarding PPDM
For onboarding PPDM, we leverage Ansible k8s modules to gather information about the Cluster as well as deploying our RBAC files, secrets and PPDM Namespace.  
the .envrc Pre-Loads the path to our KUBECONFIG file and some Environment Variables for PPDM


### Enable RBAC and onboard the cluster
Playbook *130.1_playbook_rbac_add_k8s_to_ppdm.yml* will do the magic of applying the RBAC and other required resurces. When *vcenter_address* is Specified, the Playbook will instruct PPDM to onboard a "VANILLA_ON_VSPHERE" Cluster, means, secrets for vcenter FCD will be provided in powerprotect namespace ( equals a *csi drivers as a process* switch in PPDM )
The Playbook is designed to run Initially an on Updates, as it will *ensure* the correct settings 

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/130.1_playbook_rbac_add_k8s_to_ppdm.yml -e vcenter_address=vcenter01.demo.local
```
