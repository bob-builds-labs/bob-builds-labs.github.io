# AWX PPDM Deployment
With this lab, we will deploy Templates and Worklows for the PPDM Deployment(s) 


## Update 0499 lab Configuration from Github

```bash
git -C ~/workspace/0499 pull
```

## Change to lab4

The execution environment for AWX will be evaluated from lab4 folder

```bash
cd ~/workspace/0499/lab4
direnv allow .
```

## Deploy PreReqs for VMware ( pyvmomi) when running locally

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pyvmomi
```


## To run Jobs (e.g. OVA Deployment ) against the vCenter, deploy the vcenter01 Credentials using the AWX CLI:

```bash
awx credentials create --credential_type 'VMware vCenter' --name 'vcenter01' --user admin  --inputs "{'username': 'admin@vsphere.local', 'password': 'Password123!','host': 'vcenter01.demo.local'}"
```

## Importing the Deploy Job Templates and Workflow

```bash
awx import < jt_deploy_ppdm.json
awx import < workflow_deploy_ppdm.json
```
From AWX Console, you know have the Initial Deployment Workflow, with the 2 Templates to deploy and Configure PPDM

Before we can deploy a PPDM from ansible Tower, we need to upload the deploym,ent OVA to our S3 store.

we have to Methods available:
1. Upload the ISO using the Browser
Open a Browser for the Minio Console
