# This Lab is about Deploying Exchange Agent Exchange Agent(s)


Make sure you prepared the environment using [ansible_ppdm_agents](./01.0_ansible_ppdm_agents.md)   
Make sure the VMÂ´s exchange1 and exchange2 are started
```bash
govc vm.power -on -vm.ipath="$(govc find / -type m -name exchange1)"
govc vm.power -on -vm.ipath="$(govc find / -type m -name exchange2)"
```

### Validate agent hosts Group "exchgangehosts"  ping-able vi winrm

```bash
ansible exchangehosts -m win_ping -i hosts.yaml
```

As we honly want to tackle the host named file, we use the --limit parameter

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.3_playbook_copy_and_deploy_windows_agent.yaml -i hosts.yaml --limit exchangehosts, 
```

### View Agent registration Status

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.5_get_agent_registration_status.yaml
```

### Approve Exchange Agents

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible_ppdm/100.4_create_whitelistentry.yaml -e "host_list=exchange1.demo.local,exchange2.demo.local"
```
