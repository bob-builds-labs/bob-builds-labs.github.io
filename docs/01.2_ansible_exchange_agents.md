# This Lab is about Deploying PPDM msappsagent Exchange Agent(s)


Make sure you prepared the environment using [ansible_ppdm_agents](./01.0_ansible_ppdm_agents.md)   
Make sure the VMÂ´s exchange1 and exchange2 are started
```bash
ansible-playbook ../playbooks/start_stop_vms_by_vm_names_query.yaml -e vm_names='exchange' -e state=start
```

### Validate agent hosts Group "exchgangehosts"  ping-able vi winrm

```bash
ansible exchangehosts -m win_ping -i hosts.yaml
```
Note: it might take a bit longer for the Exchange Hosts to serve winrm via HTTPS, so no panig when there is a red response. Retry

As we honly want to tackle the group named exchangehosts, we use the --limit parameter

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.3_playbook_copy_and_deploy_windows_agent.yaml -i hosts.yaml --limit exchangehosts, 
```

### View Agent registration Status

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.5_get_agent_registration_status.yaml
```

### Approve Exchange Agents
We want to tackle the addresses of the hsost as they show up from above query, so we will use a runbook that queries the agentn list from name to address:
```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.4_create_whitelistentry_from_addressquery.yaml -e "host_list=exchange1.demo.local,exchange2.demo.local"
```
