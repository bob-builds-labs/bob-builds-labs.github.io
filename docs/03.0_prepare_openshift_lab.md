# Prepare the OpenShift Lab

if not already done, clone into https://github.com/bob-builds-labs/0499.git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bob-builds-labs/0499.git ~/workspace/0499
```

## Load the Environment
Change into lab 3 and allow the environment variables to load via direnv

```bash
cd ~/workspace/0499/lab3
direnv allow .
```
## Check the python aiohttp is installed

```bash
python3 -m pip install aiohttp
```

Start the OpenShift 3-Node Cluster using ansible, govc or from the Openshift Folder on vCenter: 

```bash
ansible-playbook ../playbooks/start_stop_vms_by_vm_names_query.yaml -e vm_names='openshift' -e state=start
```

```bash
govc find / -type m -name "openshift*master-*" | xargs -I % govc vm.power -on -vm.ipath=%
```

It will take some time for the Nodes to Start.

As the nodes have been down since Deployment, there are outstanding cvertificate signing requests. Under normal Conditions, thos certificates would be renewed automatiaclly every 24hrs. 

*kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client*: signs certificates that will be honored as client certificates by the API server. Never auto-approved by kube-controller-manager.

*kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet*: signs client certificates that will be honored as client certificates by the API server. May be auto-approved by kube-controller-manager.

*kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving*: signs serving certificates that are honored as a valid kubelet serving certificate by the API server, but has no other guarantees. Never auto-approved by kube-controller-manager.


Validate the nodes are Ready:
```bash
oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master
```

If the nodes are NotReady, there might be autstanding Certificate Signing requests.  

Check with  
```bash
oc get csr
```
To approve pending Requests, run

```bash
oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
```

Repeat the Above step multiple times until all nodes show ready 
```bash
oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master
```


Wait for https://console-openshift-console.apps.openshift.demo.local to be reachable
It might take a while for the cluster to reconcile
