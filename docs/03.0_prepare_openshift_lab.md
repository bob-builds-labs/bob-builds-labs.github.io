# Prepare the OpenShift Lab

if not already done, clone into https://github.com/bob-builds-labs/0499.git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bob-builds-labs/0499.git ~/workspace/0499
```
## Load the Environment

Change into lab 3 and allow the environment variables to load via direnv

```bash
cd ~/workspace/0499/lab3
direnv allow .
```

If not already done from previois lab, start ppdm-1:

```bash
ansible-playbook ../playbooks/start_stop_vms_by_vm_names.yaml -e vm_names='ppdm-1' -e state=start
```
Start the OpenShift 3-Node Cluster using ansible, govc or from the Openshift Folder on vCenter: 

```bash
ansible-playbook ../playbooks/start_stop_vms_by_vm_names_query.yaml -e vm_names='openshift' -e state=start
```

It will take some time for the Nodes to Start. The Playbook will wait unitl the open-vmtools agents are reachable.

As the nodes have been down since Deployment, there are outstanding cvertificate signing requests. Under normal Conditions, thos certificates would be renewed automatiaclly every 24hrs. 

*kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client*: signs certificates that will be honored as client certificates by the API server. Never auto-approved by kube-controller-manager.

*kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet*: signs client certificates that will be honored as client certificates by the API server. May be auto-approved by kube-controller-manager.

*kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving*: signs serving certificates that are honored as a valid kubelet serving certificate by the API server, but has no other guarantees. Never auto-approved by kube-controller-manager.


Validate the nodes are Ready:
```bash
oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master
```

If the nodes are NotReady, there might be autstanding Certificate Signing requests.  

Check with  
```bash
oc get csr
```
To approve pending Requests, run

```bash
oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
```

Repeat the Above step multiple times until all nodes show ready 
```bash
oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master
```


Wait for https://console-openshift-console.apps.openshift.demo.local to be reachable
It might take a while for the cluster to reconcile
