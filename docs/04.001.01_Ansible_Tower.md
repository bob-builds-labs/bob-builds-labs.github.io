# AAP Ansible Automation Platform automated deployment and Configuration
from Version 3.0 of the Lab, we do use RedHat AAP Platform 2.5
some changes might have been taken into condiferations, so make sure to check the video to get started with your RedHat Account
## Prework:

From your vCenter, make sure ansible, as well Openshift and PowerProtect vApp are started:

## Deploy ( From Ansible Host )

Log into Ansible Host mRemote. If not done from previous,
Clone into 0499 if not done from earlier lab

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bob-builds-labs/0499.git ~/workspace/0499
```

Go to lab3 directory

```bash
cd ~/workspace/0499
git pull
cd ~/workspace/0499/lab3
direnv allow .
```

If OpenShift is freshly started, make sure to approve csr´s as in lab [03.0](https://github.com/bob-builds-labs/bob-builds-labs.github.io/blob/main/docs/03.0_prepare_openshift_lab.md)
This can take up to 15 Minutes and multiple CSR´s apprals for the Cluster to reconcile

```bash
oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
```

Rember to run this multiple times, until you [Openshift Console](https://console-openshift-console.apps.openshift.demo.local) is working and

```bash
oc get nodes
```

shows all nodes ready

## Important, as those Inferastructure HickUps can cause Trouble, it is recommended that you upgrade you cluster first to latest 4.14.x !!!!

From Administration, Cluster Setting, select latest 4.14 and wait .....

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c131ae-71bc-4f9c-9703-81e1bd4e599d)

or use cli to hop to every next Version :

```bash
oc adm upgrade | grep  quay.io | tail -n1 | awk '{print $1}'| xargs -I{} oc adm upgrade --to={}
```


:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: To use the 19.18 Branch (only for those who know :-) ) 

```bash
git checkout 19.18
```

## Deploy AAP to Openshift

```bash
oc create -f aap_operatorGroup.yaml
echo "Waiting for AAP Operator Pod to be deployed"

until [[ ! -z $(oc get pod -l "control-plane=controller-manager" -n aap) ]]; do echo "Sleeping 5 seconds";sleep 5; done
echo "Waiting for AAP Operator to be ready"
oc wait --for=condition=ready pod -l "control-plane=controller-manager" -n aap --timeout 600s
oc apply -f aap.yaml -n aap
echo "Waiting for AAP Controller Prod instance pod to be deployed"
until [[ ! -z $(oc get pod -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=aap-task" -n aap) ]]; do echo "Sleeping 5 seconds";sleep 5; done
echo "Waiting for AAP Controller instance to be ready"
oc wait --for=condition=ready pod -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=aap-task" -n aap --timeout 600s
```

## Configure AAP

Lets head over to lab4 environment

```bash
cd ../lab4
direnv allow .
```


## Check AAP Platform is Ready to serve

Use your Browser to connect to  [Ansible AAP PLATFORM](https://aap-platform-aap.apps.openshift.demo.local) 
use you use admin to log in.

Get the Password from:
 ```bash
echo $PLATFORM_PASSWORD
```


And start populating our AAP from ansible playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook ../playbooks/aap.yaml
echo  "You can now login to ${CONTROLLER_HOST} using ${CONTROLLER_USERNAME} with password ${CONTROLLER_PASSWORD}"
```



# Redeploy

## Remove potential previously deployed Instances

```bash
cd ~/workspace/0499/lab3
oc delete -f aap.yaml -n aap
oc delete pvc postgres-13-aap-postgres-13-0 -n aap
oc delete pvc postgres-15-aap-postgres-15-0 -n aap
oc delete -f aap_operatorGroup.yaml
oc delete ns aap
