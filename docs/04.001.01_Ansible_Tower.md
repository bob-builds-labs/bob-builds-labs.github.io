# AAP Ansible Automation Platform automated deployment and Configuration

## Prework:

From your vCenter, make sure ansible, as well Openshift and PowerProtect vApp are started:

!!!! Attention, due to a recent issue with the new Submitted lab v2.5 ( Hana Instance grabbing master2 DHCP lease ), please run the following from Powershell on Launchpad before starting OpenShift:

```Powershell
Add-DhcpServerv4Reservation -ScopeId 192.168.1.0 -IPAddress 192.168.1.108 -ClientId "005056a3bbad" -Name "openshift-72g6c-master-0.demo.local" -Description "openshift-72g6c-master-0.demo.local"
Add-DhcpServerv4Reservation -ScopeId 192.168.1.0 -IPAddress 192.168.1.111 -ClientId "005056a32d4e" -Name "openshift-72g6c-master-1.demo.local" -Description "openshift-72g6c-master-1.demo.local"
Add-DhcpServerv4Reservation -ScopeId 192.168.1.0 -IPAddress 192.168.1.104 -ClientId "005056a3729e" -Name "openshift-72g6c-master-2.demo.local" -Description "openshift-72g6c-master-2.demo.local"
```

## Deploy ( From Ansible Host )

Log into Ansible Host mRemote. If not done from previous,
Clone into 0499 if not done from earlier lab

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bob-builds-labs/0499.git ~/workspace/0499
```

Go to lab3 directory

```bash
cd ~/workspace/0499
git pull
cd ~/workspace/0499/lab3
direnv allow .
```

If OpenShift is freshly started, make sure to approve csr´s as in lab [03.0](https://github.com/bob-builds-labs/bob-builds-labs.github.io/blob/main/docs/03.0_prepare_openshift_lab.md)
This can take up to 15 Minutes and multiple CSR´s apprals for the Cluster to reconcile

```bash
oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
```

Rember to run this multiple times, until you [Openshift Console](https://console-openshift-console.apps.openshift.demo.local) is working and

```bash
oc get nodes
```

shows all nodes ready

## Important, as those Inferastructure HickUps can cause Trouble, it is recommended that you upgrade you cluster first to latest 4.14.x !!!!

From Administration, Cluster Setting, select latest 4.14 and wait .....

To use the testing Branch:

```bash
git checkout testing
```

## Deploy AAP to Openshift

```bash
oc create -f aap_operatorGroup.yaml
echo "Waiting for AAP Operator Pod to be deployed"

until [[ ! -z $(oc get pod -l "control-plane=controller-manager" -n aap) ]]; do echo "Sleeping 5 seconds";sleep 5; done
echo "Waiting for AAP Operator to be ready"
oc wait --for=condition=ready pod -l "control-plane=controller-manager" -n aap --timeout 600s
oc apply -f aap.yaml -n aap
echo "Waiting for AAP Controller Prod instance pod to be deployed"
until [[ ! -z $(oc get pod -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=aap-task" -n aap) ]]; do echo "Sleeping 5 seconds";sleep 5; done
echo "Waiting for AAP Controller instance to be ready"
oc wait --for=condition=ready pod -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=aap-task" -n aap --timeout 600s
```

## Configure AAP

Lets head over to lab4 environment

```bash
cd ../lab4
direnv allow .
```

And start populating our AAP from ansible playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook ../playbooks/aap.yaml
echo  "You can now login to ${CONTROLLER_HOST} using ${CONTROLLER_USERNAME} with password ${CONTROLLER_PASSWORD}"
```

# Redeploy

## Remove potential previously deployed Instances

```bash
oc delete -f aap.yaml -n aap
oc delete pvc postgres-13-aap-postgres-13-0 -n aap
oc delete -f aap_operatorGroup.yaml
oc delete ns aap
