# Working with windows file Agent
## Prerequisite

Make sure you prepared the environment using [ansible_ppdm_agents](./01.0_ansible_ppdm_agents.md)   
Make sure the "File VM" is started
```bash
ansible-playbook ../playbooks/start_stop_vms_by_vm_names.yaml -e vm_names='file' -e state=start
```
it will take a while for the VM to be running. Check it is reachable using win_ping

## Validate agent hostgroup "filehosts"  ping-able via winrm

```bash
ansible filehosts -m win_ping -i hosts.yaml
```
once we receive a "pong" the machines are up and reachable for ansible communication´s

Some hosts might have manually altered hosts files. We do not want this as we use DNS for Agents in the Scenario.
The Following Playbook will clear hosts for the scope og filehosts ( launchpad and file.demo.local )

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.3_playbook_clear_hosts_windows_agent.yaml -i hosts.yaml --limit filehosts,
```


## Installing the File Agent

### deploy agents to hostgroup "filehosts"
The example will use the Inventory from the previously create file "hosts.yaml".  
As we only want to tackle the hostgroup named filehosts, we use the --limit parameter
*the host list for parameter --limit must end with a comma*

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.3_playbook_copy_and_deploy_windows_agent.yaml -i hosts.yaml --limit filehosts, 
```



### View Agent registration Status

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.5_get_agent_registration_status.yaml
```

The Agent will also be visbile as "Waiting Approval" in the UI

### Agent not Showing Up ??

Smetimes the AgentService, even deployed successfully, doesn´t register with the PPDM Host. This might be due to an delayed agent startup issue.

The following runbook will try to start the Agent:
```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.3_playbook_check_AgentService.yaml -i hosts.yaml --limit filehosts, 
```


### Approve File Agent
as we could see from the Agent registration Status, the Agent´s address is the primary IP Address.  We need to Approve the Host with a whitelist using the primary IP Address.

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.4_create_whitelistentry.yaml -e "host_list=192.168.1.107,192.168.1.2"
```

the agent status should transfer to Approving Certificates

```bash
