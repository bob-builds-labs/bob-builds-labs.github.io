# This lab will showcase etcd Backups to Datadomain

## Requirements


cd into lab3

```bash
cd ~/workspace/0499/lab3
direnv allow .
```
clone into the ansible_ppdd Repository if not already done:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bottkars/ansible_ppdd ~/workspace/ansible_ppdd
```

### Enable NFS v4 along with v3 on Datadomain

```bash
ansible-playbook  ~/workspace/ansible_ppdd/130.2_Playbook_enable_nfsv3v4.yml
```

Next, create an NFS export and expose to the Master Nodes

```bash
ansible-playbook  ~/workspace/ansible_ppdd/130.3_Playbook_create_dd_mtree_with_nfs_add_k8s_nodes.yml -e mtree_name=ocp_etcd
```

This should create the NFS Export with the Clients from Oi

Finally, we create a CronJob in the Openshift Cluster

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/0499/playbooks/create_ocp_etcd_backup.yaml -e mtree_name=ocp_etcd
```
