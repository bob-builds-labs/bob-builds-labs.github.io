# This Lab is about Deploying PPDM msappsagent SQL Agent(s)


Make sure you prepared the environment using [ansible_ppdm_agents](./01.0_ansible_ppdm_agents.md)   
For this lab we use SQL01 and SQL01, wich are deployed in the Hosted Cluster. They are already Up and Running in from the vCloud Director in the VLAB. So we do not need to start them up front

### Validate agent hosts Group "databasehosts"  ping-able via winrm

```bash
ansible "windows:&databasehosts" -m win_ping -i hosts.yaml
```

### Ensuring local sql service user exists, and  login exists in the master DB when usig AAG Hosts

Hint: As we only want to tackle the group named databasehosts, we use the --limit parameter

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/120.0_ensure_mssql_aag_local_user.yaml  \
-i hosts.yaml --limit 'windows:&databasehosts' 
```

### Deploying the Agent

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.3_playbook_copy_and_deploy_windows_agent.yaml -i hosts.yaml --limit 'windows:&databasehosts' 
```
### View Agent registration Status

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.5_get_agent_registration_status.yaml
```
### Agent not Showing Up ??

Smetimes the AgentService, even deployed successfully, doesnÂ´t register with the PPDM Host. This might be due to an delayed agent startup issue.

The following runbook will try to start the Agent:
```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.3_playbook_check_AgentService.yaml -i hosts.yaml --limit 'windows:&databasehosts' 
```

### Register the Agent

We want to tackle the addresses of the host as they show up from above query, so we will use a runbook that resolves the agent list from name to address:

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.4_create_whitelistentry_from_addressquery.yaml -e "host_list=SQL02.demo.local,SQL01.demo.local"
```
### View Agent registration Status

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.5_get_agent_registration_status.yaml
```
