# This Lab is about Deploying PPDM msappsagent SQL Agent(s)


Make sure you prepared the environment using [ansible_ppdm_agents](./01.0_ansible_ppdm_agents.md)   
For this lab we use SQL01 and SQL01, wich are deployed in the Hosted Cluster. They are already Up and Running in from the vCloud Director in the VLAB.

### Validate agent hosts Group "databasehosts"  ping-able via winrm

```bash
ansible "windows:&databasehosts" -m win_ping -i hosts.yaml
```

### Ensuring local User exists when usig AAG Hosts

Hint: As we only want to tackle the group named databasehosts, we use the --limit parameter

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/120.0_ensure_mssql_aag_local_user.yaml  \
-i hosts.yaml --limit 'windows:&databasehosts' 
```

### Deploying the Agent

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.3_playbook_copy_and_deploy_windows_agent.yaml -i hosts.yaml --limit 'windows:&databasehosts' 
```

### View Agent registration Status

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.5_get_agent_registration_status.yaml
```

We want to tackle the addresses of the host as they show up from above query, so we will use a runbook that resolves the agent list from name to address:

```bash
ansible-playbook ~/workspace/ansible_ppdm/100.4_create_whitelistentry_from_addressquery.yaml -e "host_list=SQL02.demo.local,SQL01.demo.local"
```
