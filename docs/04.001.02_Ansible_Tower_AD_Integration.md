# AAP Ansible Automation Platform Active Directory Integration
from Version 3.0 of the Lab, we do use RedHat AAP Platform 2.4
some changes might have been taken into considerations, so make sure to check the video to get started with your RedHat Account
## Integrating AAP with Active Directory



To create a Ansible AAP LDAP Integration, we first need to run a playbook from lab4:

if not already done,

```bash
cd ~/workspace/0499/lab4
git pull
```

Run:
```bash
ansible-playbook ../playbooks/aap_ldap.yaml
```

For now, no user is allowed to sign in. These assignments will be created from Active Directory

Therefor, we have to create several AD Groups from Powershell

For this, start a Powershell Session on Launchpad

```powershell
New-ADGroup AAP_USERS -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users allowed to log into Ansible Automation Platform"
New-ADGroup AAP_INFRA_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Infra Team"
New-ADGroup AAP_K8S_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Kubernetes Team"
New-ADGroup AAP_APP_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP APP Team"
New-ADGroup AAP_SUPERUSER -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Superuser Group"
New-ADGroup AAP_ADMIN_USERS -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Admin Group"
```

Now we have to Create User Access. This is always a multi step Procedure.
When a USer is member of AAP_USERS, He can LogIn as view only.
Second step is assign Advanced User Rights and/or Team Assignments  


To allow user administrator to log into AAP, use

```powershell
Get-ADGroup AAP_USERS | Add-ADGroupMember -Members administrator
```
To make the user a Superuser, Assign him to the Group AAP_SUPERUSER

```
Get-ADGroup AAP_SUPERUSER | Add-ADGroupMember -Members administrator
```


To allow user ppdm@demo.local to log into AAP, use

```powershell
Get-ADGroup AAP_USERS | Add-ADGroupMember -Members ppdm
```
To make the user member of PPDM Infra Team, Assign him to the Group AAP_INFRA_TEAM

```powershell
Get-ADGroup AAP_INFRA_TEAM | Add-ADGroupMember -Members ppdm
```
