# AAP Ansible Automation Platform Active Directory Integration
from Version 3.0 of the Lab, we do use RedHat AAP Platform 2.4
some changes might have been taken into considerations, so make sure to check the video to get started with your RedHat Account
## Integrating AAP with Active Directory


First we have to create several AD Groups:


```powershell


$GROUP_AAP_USERS=New-ADGroup AAP_USERS -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users allowed to log into Ansible Automation Platform"
$GROUP_AAP_INFRA=New-ADGroup AAP_INFRA_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Infra Team"
$GROUP_AAP_K8S=New-ADGroup AAP_K8S_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Kubernetes Team"
$GROUP_AAP_APP=New-ADGroup AAP_APP_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP APP Team"
$GROUP_SUPERUSER=New-ADGroup AAP_SUPERUSER -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Superuser Group"
$GROUP_AAP_ADMIN_USERS=New-ADGroup AAP_ADMIN_USERS -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Admin Group"

$GROUP_AAP_USERS| Add-ADGroupMember -Members $GROUP_AAP_INFRA,$GROUP_AAP_K8S,$GROUP_AAP_APP,$GROUP_AAP_ADMIN_USERS,$GROUP_SUPERUSER
$GROUP_AAP_USERS| Add-ADGroupMember -Members user2,user1,ppdm,administrator

```
