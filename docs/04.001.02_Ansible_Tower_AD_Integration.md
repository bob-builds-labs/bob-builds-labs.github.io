## Integrating AAP with Active Directory


First we have to create several AD Groups:


```powershell

$USERGROUP=Get-ADGroup users 
$GROUP_AAP_USERS=$USERGROUP| New-ADGroup AAP_USERS -GroupCategory Security -Description "Users allowed to log into Ansible Automation Platform"
$GROUP_AAP_INFRA=$USERGROUP| New-ADGroup AAP_INFRA_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -Description "Users member of AAP Infra Team"
$GROUP_AAP_K8S=$USERGROUP| New-ADGroup AAP_K8S_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -Description "Users member of AAP Kubernetes Team"
$GROUP_AAP_APP=$USERGROUP| New-ADGroup AAP_APP_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -Description "Users member of AAP APP Team"

$GROUP_AAP_USERS| Add-ADGroupMember -Members $GROUP_AAP_INFRA,$GROUP_AAP_K8S,$GROUP_AAP_APP
$GROUP_AAP_USERS| Add-ADGroupMember -Members user2,user1,ppdm,administrator

```
