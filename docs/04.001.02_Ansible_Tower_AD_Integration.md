## Integrating AAP with Active Directory


First we have to create several AD Groups:


```powershell
New-ADGroup AAP_USERS -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users allowed to log into Ansible Automation Platform"
New-ADGroup AAP_INFRA_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Infra Team"
New-ADGroup AAP_K8S_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Kubernetes Team"
New-ADGroup AAP_APP_TEAM -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP APP Team"
New-ADGroup AAP_SUPERUSER -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Superuser Group"
New-ADGroup AAP_ADMIN_USERS -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope DomainLocal -Description "Users members of AAP Admin Group"

Get-ADGroup AAP_USERS | Add-ADGroupMember -Members AAP_INFRA_TEAM,AAP_K8S_TEAM,AAP_APP_TEAM,AAP_SUPERUSER,AAP_ADMIN_USERS
