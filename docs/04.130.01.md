# AWX Buildup Asset Related Jobs and Workflows Jobs
With this lab, we will deploy Templates to Retrieve the Agents from PPDM

```bash
cd ~/workspace/0499/lab4
direnv allow .
```

## Import Jobs

Ansible can Host Project Enfironments on SCM systems. We host our Inventory as well as the ansible_ppdm Modules on Github.  

To import them, we use:





```bash
awx job_templates list -f human
```


## Import Workflows

```bash
awx import < workflow_assets.json
```
This should import asset related workflow job templates .
